- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Solution: [Github Pages](https://your-solution-url.com)

## My process

I set up my preferred file structure, built the layout first, then customised individual elements in a way that keeps the structure nice and neat. The project was very easy, so there's not much to say about the process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Sass (using the Live Sass Complire extension for VS Code)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've not learned so much as I've trained. I've done a lot, one might say too much, research on front-end languages before I started practicing. Lucky for me, I'm super passionate about the subject, which allowed me to retain most of the information I've researched. As a result, I breezed through this challenge, and should probably attempt a level 2 challenge next.
